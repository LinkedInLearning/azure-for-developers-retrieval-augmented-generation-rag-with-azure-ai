Curving Cloud Streets
Brazil and Bolivia  

To the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves, 

airborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.

Acquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it 

appeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that 

humid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. 

Cumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. 

Usually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems, 

as they did here.=================

Folds and Curves of the Kavir
Iran

When astronauts pass over the deserts of central Iran, they are greeted by a striking pattern of parallel lines and sweeping curves. 

The lack of soil and vegetation in the Kavir desert (Dasht-e Kavir) allows the geological structure to appear quite clearly. 

The patterns result from the gentle folding of numerous, thin layers of rock. Later, erosion by wind and water cut a flat surface across 

the dark- and light-colored folds, not only exposing hundreds of layers but also showing the shapes of the folds. The pattern has 

been likened to the layers of a sliced onion.

The dark water of a lake (image center) fills a depression in a more easily eroded, S-shaped layer of rock. A small river snakes across

From Rainforest to Rain Shadow
United States

Within a three-hour drive across Oregon, you can visit a beach, a temperate rainforest, a mountain glacier, and the high desert.  

The diversity of the landscape is mostly driven by the interaction of air masses and mountains.

This false-color Landsat 5 image from October 2011 shows the bare soil and sparse vegetation of the high desert in shades of pink, 

together with the deep-green vegetation on the west side of the Cascade Mountains. The one blue spot is the glacial cap of Mount Hood. 

The transition from green to brown is indicative of a “rain shadow.” Winds blowing from the west carry moisture from the Pacific 

Ocean. As the air moves up into the mountains, it cools and the pressure decreases; the moisture condenses and falls out as rain or 

snow. On the eastern side, as the elevation drops, the air pressure increases and the air warms, effectively shutting off precipitation 

because the air can better hold the remaining moisture.","In June 2014, the Aqua satellite captured an image showing a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia.

The Zones of Kilimanjaro
Tanzania

Stories about Mount Kilimanjaro often focus on its height and location. The tallest mountain in Africa is capped with snow and ice, 

despite sitting near the Equator. But it is also compelling for a different reason: To get to the icy summit, you must pass through 

incredibly diverse vegetation zones. The mountain rises from the hot, dry savanna, through rainforest and hardy scrublands, to a 

rocky and icy summit.

People have cultivated the lowlands ringing the mountain, which appear as patchy green areas. The continuous dark-green band is 

montane forest, which stretches from roughly 1,800 to 2,800 meters in elevation. The dark-green areas transition to a band of green-

brown known as the moorland zone—colder, less humid, and full of short, hardy plants. The highest areas—the alpine desert and 

summit zones—are inhospitable to all but the most skilled mountain climbers.=================

Don Juan Pond
Antarctica

In a valley in one of the most extreme environments on Earth lies the world’s saltiest body of water. It rarely snows and never rains in 

the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Winter temperatures can drop to –50° Celsius, and the few ponds and lakes are capped by 

ice that is several meters thick.

Then there’s Don Juan Pond. The ankle-deep pond in Upper Wright Valley is so salty that its calcium chloride–rich waters rarely 

freeze. With a salinity level of over 40 percent, Don Juan is significantly saltier than the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake.

The Earth Observing-1 satellite captured this image in January 2014. The ellipse-shaped lake is situated at the bottom of a basin

Bowknot Bend
United States

This section of the Green River canyon in eastern Utah is known as Bowknot Bend because of the way the river doubles back on 

itself. The loop carries river rafters 14.5 kilometers (9 miles) before bringing them back to nearly the same point they started from—

though on the other side of a low, narrow saddle. The reason for the tight bends in the Green River is the same as it is for the mighty 

Mississippi: river courses often wind over time when they flow across a bed of relatively soft sediment in a floodplain.

In this January 2014 photograph taken from the International Space Station, the Green River appears dark because it lies in deep 

shadow, 300 meters (1,000 feet) below the surrounding landscape. The yellow-tinged cliffs that face the rising Sun give a sense of 

the steep canyon walls. The straight white line across the scene is the contrail from a jetliner.=================

Fanning Out in Farmland
Kazakhstan

Mountain streams are usually confined to narrow channels and tend to transport large amounts of gravel, sand, clay, and silt—

what geologists call alluvium. When such a stream pours onto a relatively flat valley or basin, it often spreads out to into multiple, 

interlacing channels. Over time, the channels migrate back and forth, creating fan-shaped deposits known as alluvial fans.

Landsat 8 captured this view of Kazakhstan’s Almaty Province in September 2013. On the lower left, the Tente River flows through 

the foothills of the Dzungarian Alatau range. Where the Tente emerges, it spreads out and becomes a braided stream. The 

movement of the channel over time has left a large alluvial fan. In arid areas, these fans are often used for agriculture because they 

are relatively flat and provide groundwater for irrigation. The blocky green patterns show fields or pasture land.","In Oregon, within a three-hour drive, you can experience a variety of landscapes including a beach, a temperate rainforest, a mountain glacier, and the high desert.

Bedouins tapped underground water supplies here at least five centuries ago, and date farms have proliferated. Drip irrigation 

and greenhouses now help conserve the precious water supply. Since rainfall is scarce in the region, much of the water comes 

from aquifers full of “fossil” water that accumulated more than 20,000 years ago and is now buried deep under the sand seas and 

limestone formations.=================

Taranaki and Egmont
New Zealand

The circular pattern of New Zealand’s Egmont National Park stands out from space as a human fingerprint on the landscape.  

The park protects the forested and snow-capped slopes around Mount Taranaki (Mount Egmont to British settlers). It was 

established in 1900, when officials drew a radius of 10 kilometers around the volcanic peak. The colors differentiate the protected 

forest (dark green) from once-forested pasturelands (light- and brown-green).

Named by the native Maori people, Taranaki stands 2,518 meters (8,260 feet) tall, and it is one of the world’s most symmetric 

volcanoes. It first became active about 135,000 years ago. By dating lava flows, geologists have figured out that small  

eruptions occur roughly every 90 years and major eruptions every 500 years. Landsat 8 acquired this image of Taranaki and the  

park in July 2014.","The Earth Observing-1 satellite captured an image of Don Juan Pond in January 2014, providing valuable insights into this unique body of water located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica.

Taranaki and Egmont
New Zealand

The circular pattern of New Zealand’s Egmont National Park stands out from space as a human fingerprint on the landscape.  

The park protects the forested and snow-capped slopes around Mount Taranaki (Mount Egmont to British settlers). It was 

established in 1900, when officials drew a radius of 10 kilometers around the volcanic peak. The colors differentiate the protected 

forest (dark green) from once-forested pasturelands (light- and brown-green).

Named by the native Maori people, Taranaki stands 2,518 meters (8,260 feet) tall, and it is one of the world’s most symmetric 

volcanoes. It first became active about 135,000 years ago. By dating lava flows, geologists have figured out that small  

eruptions occur roughly every 90 years and major eruptions every 500 years. Landsat 8 acquired this image of Taranaki and the  

park in July 2014.=================

The Zones of Kilimanjaro
Tanzania

Stories about Mount Kilimanjaro often focus on its height and location. The tallest mountain in Africa is capped with snow and ice, 

despite sitting near the Equator. But it is also compelling for a different reason: To get to the icy summit, you must pass through 

incredibly diverse vegetation zones. The mountain rises from the hot, dry savanna, through rainforest and hardy scrublands, to a 

rocky and icy summit.

People have cultivated the lowlands ringing the mountain, which appear as patchy green areas. The continuous dark-green band is 

montane forest, which stretches from roughly 1,800 to 2,800 meters in elevation. The dark-green areas transition to a band of green-

brown known as the moorland zone—colder, less humid, and full of short, hardy plants. The highest areas—the alpine desert and 

summit zones—are inhospitable to all but the most skilled mountain climbers.=================

From Rainforest to Rain Shadow
United States

Within a three-hour drive across Oregon, you can visit a beach, a temperate rainforest, a mountain glacier, and the high desert.  

The diversity of the landscape is mostly driven by the interaction of air masses and mountains.

This false-color Landsat 5 image from October 2011 shows the bare soil and sparse vegetation of the high desert in shades of pink, 

together with the deep-green vegetation on the west side of the Cascade Mountains. The one blue spot is the glacial cap of Mount Hood. 

The transition from green to brown is indicative of a “rain shadow.” Winds blowing from the west carry moisture from the Pacific 

Ocean. As the air moves up into the mountains, it cools and the pressure decreases; the moisture condenses and falls out as rain or 

snow. On the eastern side, as the elevation drops, the air pressure increases and the air warms, effectively shutting off precipitation 

because the air can better hold the remaining moisture.","Mount Taranaki, also known as Mount Egmont to British settlers, is 2,518 meters (8,260 feet) tall.

"What are the characteristics and significance of linear dunes in the Caprivi Strip, Namibia, and how do they contribute to understanding past ecological and climatic conditions?","- The linear dunes in the Caprivi Strip of northeastern Namibia are lengthy, with some extending over 100 kilometers (60 miles).
- These dunes form from wind-blown sand over many years and are characterized by their ability to remain intact long after dry conditions have ceased, unlike other types of dunes that migrate over time.
- Their preservation of dirt and rocks makes them valuable for geologists who use them to understand past ecological and climatic conditions.

Summary: Linear dunes in Namibia's Caprivi Strip are significant due to their length, stability, and ability to preserve geological materials, which are useful for studying historical ecological and climate conditions. (source: page-121.pdf)","TITLE: page-121.pdf, CONTENT: L

Linear Dunes, Caprivi Strip
Namibia

In far northeastern Namibia, there is a skinny stretch of land sandwiched between Angola, Botswana, and Zambia. The Caprivi Strip 

receives about 600 millimeters (24 inches) of rainfall each year. That’s not a lot of rain—it tends to come in bursts that cause periodic 

floods—and it is a stark contrast to the much drier parts of the country.

Here the land is striped, as if a giant had dragged a rake over the landscape. Those stripes are linear dunes, and some of them are 

more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) long. Dunes generally form from wind-blown sand over many years, and one characteristic of 

linear dunes is that they tend to remain intact long after the dry conditions cease. And because they don’t migrate like marching 

dunes, linear dunes preserve dirt and rocks that geologists can later use to understand past conditions.=================

Folds and Curves of the Kavir
Iran

When astronauts pass over the deserts of central Iran, they are greeted by a striking pattern of parallel lines and sweeping curves. 

The lack of soil and vegetation in the Kavir desert (Dasht-e Kavir) allows the geological structure to appear quite clearly. 

The patterns result from the gentle folding of numerous, thin layers of rock. Later, erosion by wind and water cut a flat surface across 

the dark- and light-colored folds, not only exposing hundreds of layers but also showing the shapes of the folds. The pattern has 

been likened to the layers of a sliced onion.

Curving Cloud Streets
Brazil and Bolivia  

To the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves, 

airborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.

Acquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it 

appeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that 

humid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. 

Cumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. 

Usually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems, 

as they did here.=================

Colorful Faults of Xinjiang
China

Just south of the Tien Shan mountains, in northwestern Xinjiang province, a remarkable series of ridges dominates the landscape. 

The hills are decorated with distinctive red, green, and cream-colored sedimentary rock layers. The colors reflect rocks that formed 

at different times and in different environments. The red layers near the top of the sequence are Devonian sandstones formed 

by ancient rivers. The green layers are Silurian sandstones formed in a moderately deep ocean. The cream-colored layers are 

Cambrian-Ordovician limestone formed in a shallow ocean.

Landsat 8 captured this image of the Keping Shan thrust belt in July 2013. When land masses collide, the pressure can create 

what geologists call “fold and thrust belts.” Slabs of sedimentary rock that were laid down horizontally can be squeezed into wavy 

anticlines and synclines. Sometimes the rock layers break completely, and older layers of rock pile up on top of younger layers.","In October 2014, a photograph taken from the International Space Station captured the Kavir desert in central Iran, showing a striking pattern of parallel lines and sweeping curves.

What role does the Tente River play in the formation of alluvial fans in Kazakhstan's Almaty Province?,"- The Tente River plays a significant role in the formation of alluvial fans in Kazakhstan's Almaty Province. After flowing through the foothills of the Dzungarian Alatau range, the river spreads out and becomes a braided stream, which contributes to the development of a large alluvial fan. These alluvial fans are formed as the river's channel moves over time, depositing gravel, sand, clay, and silt.
- In arid areas, such as this region, alluvial fans are often repurposed for agriculture due to their relatively flat surfaces and the availability of groundwater for irrigation. (Source: page-111.pdf)","TITLE: page-111.pdf, CONTENT: L

Fanning Out in Farmland
Kazakhstan

Mountain streams are usually confined to narrow channels and tend to transport large amounts of gravel, sand, clay, and silt—

what geologists call alluvium. When such a stream pours onto a relatively flat valley or basin, it often spreads out to into multiple, 

interlacing channels. Over time, the channels migrate back and forth, creating fan-shaped deposits known as alluvial fans.

Landsat 8 captured this view of Kazakhstan’s Almaty Province in September 2013. On the lower left, the Tente River flows through 

the foothills of the Dzungarian Alatau range. Where the Tente emerges, it spreads out and becomes a braided stream. The 

movement of the channel over time has left a large alluvial fan. In arid areas, these fans are often used for agriculture because they 

are relatively flat and provide groundwater for irrigation. The blocky green patterns show fields or pasture land.=================

Liwa Oasis
United Arab Emirates

In the sandy tan terrain of the United Arab Emirates, on the northern edge of the Rub’ al Khali, an oasis brings green to the desert. 

The T-shaped, 100-kilometer stretch of date plantations and small towns compose the Liwa Oasis, home to about 20,000 people in 

the emirate of Abu Dhabi. It is one of the largest oases on the Arabian Peninsula.

Bedouins tapped underground water supplies here at least five centuries ago, and date farms have proliferated. Drip irrigation 

and greenhouses now help conserve the precious water supply. Since rainfall is scarce in the region, much of the water comes 

from aquifers full of “fossil” water that accumulated more than 20,000 years ago and is now buried deep under the sand seas and 

limestone formations.","The Tente River flows through the foothills of the Dzungarian Alatau range and, upon emerging, spreads out and becomes a braided stream.
