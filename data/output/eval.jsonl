That\u2019s not a lot of rain\u2014it tends to come in bursts that cause periodic \n\nfloods\u2014and it is a stark contrast to the much drier parts of the country.\n\nHere the land is striped, as if a giant had dragged a rake over the landscape. Those stripes are linear dunes, and some of them are \n\nmore than 100 kilometers (60 miles) long. Dunes generally form from wind-blown sand over many years, and one characteristic of \n\nlinear dunes is that they tend to remain intact long after the dry conditions cease. And because they don\u2019t migrate like marching \n\ndunes, linear dunes preserve dirt and rocks that geologists can later use to understand past conditions.=================\nTITLE: page-109.pdf, CONTENT: L\na\n\nn\nd\n\nE\nA\n\nR\nT\n\nH\n\n102\n\nFolds and Curves of the Kavir\nIran\n\nWhen astronauts pass over the deserts of central Iran, they are greeted by a striking pattern of parallel lines and sweeping curves. \n\nThe lack of soil and vegetation in the Kavir desert (Dasht-e Kavir) allows the geological structure to appear quite clearly. \n\nThe patterns result from the gentle folding of numerous, thin layers of rock.
