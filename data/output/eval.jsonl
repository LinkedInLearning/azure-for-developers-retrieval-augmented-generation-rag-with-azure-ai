The Caprivi Strip \n\nreceives about 600 millimeters (24 inches) of rainfall each year. That\u2019s not a lot of rain\u2014it tends to come in bursts that cause periodic \n\nfloods\u2014and it is a stark contrast to the much drier parts of the country.\n\nHere the land is striped, as if a giant had dragged a rake over the landscape. Those stripes are linear dunes, and some of them are \n\nmore than 100 kilometers (60 miles) long. Dunes generally form from wind-blown sand over many years, and one characteristic of \n\nlinear dunes is that they tend to remain intact long after the dry conditions cease. And because they don\u2019t migrate like marching \n\ndunes, linear dunes preserve dirt and rocks that geologists can later use to understand past conditions.=================\nTITLE: page-125.pdf, CONTENT: L\na\n\nn\nd\n\nE\nA\n\nR\nT\n\nH\n\n118\n\nTaranaki and Egmont\nNew Zealand\n\nThe circular pattern of New Zealand\u2019s Egmont National Park stands out from space as a human fingerprint on the landscape.  \n\nThe park protects the forested and snow-capped slopes around Mount Taranaki (Mount Egmont to British settlers). It was \n\nestablished in 1900, when officials drew a radius of 10 kilometers around the volcanic peak. The colors differentiate the protected \n\nforest (dark green) from once-forested pasturelands (light- and brown-green).\n\nNamed by the native Maori people, Taranaki stands 2,518 meters (8,260 feet) tall, and it is one of the world\u2019s most symmetric \n\nvolcanoes. It first became active about 135,000 years ago. By dating lava flows, geologists have figured out that small  \n\neruptions occur roughly every 90 years and major eruptions every 500 years. Landsat 8 acquired this image of Taranaki and the  \n\npark in July\u00a02014.=================\nTITLE: page-115.pdf, CONTENT: L\na\n\nn\nd\n\nE\nA\n\nR\nT\n\nH\n\n108\n\nThe Zones of Kilimanjaro\nTanzania\n\nStories about Mount Kilimanjaro often focus on its height and location. The tallest mountain in Africa is capped with snow and ice, \n\ndespite sitting near the Equator. But it is also compelling for a different reason: To get to the icy summit, you must pass through \n\nincredibly diverse vegetation zones. The mountain rises from the hot, dry savanna, through rainforest and hardy scrublands, to a \n\nrocky and icy summit.\n\nPeople have cultivated the lowlands ringing the mountain, which appear as patchy green areas. The continuous dark-green band is \n\nmontane forest, which stretches from roughly 1,800 to 2,800 meters in elevation. The dark-green areas transition to a band of green-\n\nbrown known as the moorland zone\u2014colder, less humid, and full of short, hardy plants. The highest areas\u2014the alpine desert and \n\nsummit zones\u2014are inhospitable to all but the most skilled mountain climbers.","ground_truth":"In the far northeastern region of Namibia, adjacent to Botswana, lies the Caprivi Strip, a narrow stretch of land bordered by Angola and Zambia as well. This area receives about 600 millimeters (24 inches) of rainfall annually, which is relatively low and often results in periodic floods due to the rain coming in bursts. The landscape here is characterized by linear dunes, which appear as if a giant rake has been dragged across the land. Some of these dunes extend over 100 kilometers (60 miles) in length. Linear dunes are formed from wind-blown sand accumulated over many years. Unlike marching dunes, linear dunes do not migrate, which allows them to preserve the dirt and rocks within them. This preservation is significant for geologists, as it provides valuable insights into past environmental conditions long after the dry conditions have ceased."}
