Aqua satellite cloud patterns Amazon June 2014,"['Curving Cloud Streets Brazil and Bolivia\n\nTo the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves,\n\nairborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.\n\nAcquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it\n\nappeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that\n\nhumid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds.\n\nCumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind.\n\nUsually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems,\n\nas they did here.\n\nE R E H P S O M T A\n\n4']","In June 2014, the Aqua satellite captured an image showing a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia.
