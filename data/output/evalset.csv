What atmospheric phenomena related to cloud patterns were observed in Bolivia in June 2014?,"['Curving Cloud Streets Brazil and Bolivia\n\nTo the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves,\n\nairborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.\n\nAcquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it\n\nappeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that\n\nhumid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds.\n\nCumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind.\n\nUsually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems,\n\nas they did here.\n\nE R E H P S O M T A\n\n4']","In June 2014, the Aqua satellite captured an image showing a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia.

What makes Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa a unique adventure for climbers?,"['The Zones of Kilimanjaro Tanzania\n\nStories about Mount Kilimanjaro often focus on its height and location. The tallest mountain in Africa is capped with snow and ice,\n\ndespite sitting near the Equator.

The mountain rises from the hot, dry savanna, through rainforest and hardy scrublands, to a\n\nrocky and icy summit.\n\nPeople have cultivated the lowlands ringing the mountain, which appear as patchy green areas. The continuous dark-green band is\n\nmontane forest, which stretches from roughly 1,800 to 2,800 meters in elevation. The dark-green areas transition to a band of green-\n\nbrown known as the moorland zone—colder, less humid, and full of short, hardy plants.

Wht are the diffrent landscapes in the Unted States as seen in Oregon?,"['From Rainforest to Rain Shadow United States\n\nWithin a three-hour drive across Oregon, you can visit a beach, a temperate rainforest, a mountain glacier, and the high desert.\n\nThe diversity of the landscape is mostly driven by the interaction of air masses and mountains.\n\nThis false-color Landsat 5 image from October 2011 shows the bare soil and sparse vegetation of the high desert in shades of pink,\n\ntogether with the deep-green vegetation on the west side of the Cascade Mountains. The one blue spot is the glacial cap of Mount Hood.\n\nThe transition from green to brown is indicative of a “rain shadow.” Winds blowing from the west carry moisture from the Pacific\n\nOcean.
